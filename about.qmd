title: "My About Page?"
---

So, uh when I was reading the instructions for setting up this page, I didn't quite understand if I needed just either a Home or an About page, or if I needed both. Thus, I decided to do both just to make sure I don't get points taken off for silly things. The only silly things I like is the ones that make me laugh and don't bring down my GPA. Anyways, I already put a lot of basic information about myself on the Home page, so I don't really know what to put on here. How about a fun fact? This year, 2025, is a perfect sum of the first ten cubes!\

```{r}
0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3
```

Yes, I'm counting 0 as one of the first ten cubes. Sue me. I think the phrase "first ten cubes" is a lot cooler than "first nine cubes". Maybe in 3025 I'll use this fun fact again with the "first ten cubes" again, but this time with 10 instead of 0.
