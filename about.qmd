Hey there, welcome to My About page!\
My name is Minsong Kim, and I am a student at Pomona College at the time of writing this page. I have a love-hate relationship with math and school, and I enjoy exploring and messing around with data! I'm from South Korea, and I've got a dog and a cat.

How about a fun fact? This year (at the time of writing this page), 2025, is a perfect sum of the first ten cubes!\

```{r}
0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3
```

Yes, I'm counting 0 as one of the first ten cubes. I think the phrase "first ten cubes" is a lot cooler than "first nine cubes". Maybe in 3025 I'll use this fun fact again with the "first ten cubes" again, but this time with 10 instead of 0.
