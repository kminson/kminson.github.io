    "text": "So, uh when I was reading the instructions for Project 1, I didn’t quite understand if I needed just either a Home or an About page, or if I needed both. Thus, I decided to do both just to make sure I don’t get points taken off for silly things. The only silly things I like is the ones that make me laugh and don’t bring down my GPA. Anyways, I already put a lot of basic information about myself on the Home page, so I don’t really know what to put on here. How about a fun fact? This year, 2025, is a perfect sum of the first ten cubes!\n\n\n0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3\n\n[1] 2025\n\n\nYes, I’m counting 0 as one of the first ten cubes. Sue me. I think the phrase “first ten cubes” is a lot cooler than “first nine cubes”. Maybe in 3025 I’ll use this fun fact again with the “first ten cubes” again, but this time with 10 instead of 0."

    "text": "Every pokemon has a list of base stats that correspond to their abilities. A pokemon with a base speed stat of 10 will be faster than a pokemon with a base speed state of 5. Base stat totals are one way to roughly measure a pokemon’s total power level, by adding up the stat totals across all their stats. Generally, if a pokemon with a higher base stat total will be stronger than a pokemon with a lower one. A pokemon’s egg group also classifies what kind of pokemon it is. A dragon egg group pokemon will be pokemon that is dragon-like in some way, while a flying egg group pokemon might be a bird of some sort. I also created another measurement called size index, which takes a pokemon’s height and weight, and multiplies them together to create a unit of measurement that measures both the size and the density of a pokemon roughly. I then plotted every pokemon by their size index versus their base stat totals to see if there was a correlational relationship between the two. I also colored each pokemon by their primary egg group and created a regression line for each egg group so we can see a pattern for each individual egg group and compare them with one another.\n\n\nCode\npokemon_df |&gt;\n  mutate(bst = hp + attack + defense + special_attack + special_defense + speed) |&gt;\n  mutate(size_index = height * weight)|&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = size_index, y = bst, color = egg_group_1)) +\n    geom_point(size = 2.0) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1.2, se = FALSE) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Size Index (Height * Weight)\",\n      y = \"Base Stat Total\",\n      title = \"Size Index vs. Base Stat Total\",\n      color = \"Egg Group\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 40),      \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 40),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 30)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit:\nTidyTuesday Page:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-04-01\nDataset Original Source:\nhttps://github.com/williamorim/pokemon\nCurated by Frank Hull:\nhttps://github.com/frankiethull"
