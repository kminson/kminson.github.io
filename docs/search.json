Thus, I decided to do both just to make sure I don’t get points taken off for silly things. The only silly things I like is the ones that make me laugh and don’t bring down my GPA. Anyways, I already put a lot of basic information about myself on the Home page, so I don’t really know what to put on here. How about a fun fact? This year, 2025, is a perfect sum of the first ten cubes!\n\n\n0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3\n\n[1] 2025\n\n\nYes, I’m counting 0 as one of the first ten cubes. Sue me. I think the phrase “first ten cubes” is a lot cooler than “first nine cubes”. Maybe in 3025 I’ll use this fun fact again with the “first ten cubes” again, but this time with 10 instead of 0."

    "text": "Every pokemon has a list of base stats that correspond to their abilities. A pokemon with a base speed stat of 10 will be faster than a pokemon with a base speed state of 5. Base stat totals are one way to roughly measure a pokemon’s total power level, by adding up the stat totals across all their stats. Generally, if a pokemon with a higher base stat total will be stronger than a pokemon with a lower one. A pokemon’s egg group also classifies what kind of pokemon it is. A dragon egg group pokemon will be pokemon that is dragon-like in some way, while a flying egg group pokemon might be a bird of some sort. I also created another measurement called size index, which takes a pokemon’s height and weight, and multiplies them together to create a unit of measurement that measures both the size and the density of a pokemon roughly. I then plotted every pokemon by their size index versus their base stat totals to see if there was a correlational relationship between the two. I also colored each pokemon by their primary egg group and created a regression line for each egg group so we can see a pattern for each individual egg group and compare them with one another.\n\n\nCode\npokemon_df |&gt;\n  mutate(bst = hp + attack + defense + special_attack + special_defense + speed) |&gt;\n  mutate(size_index = height * weight)|&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(x = size_index, y = bst, color = egg_group_1)) +\n    geom_point(size = 2.0) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = comma) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1.2, se = FALSE) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Size Index (Height * Weight)\",\n      y = \"Base Stat Total\",\n      title = \"Size Index vs. Base Stat Total\",\n      color = \"Egg Group\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 40),      \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 40),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 30)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit:\nTidyTuesday Page:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-04-01\nDataset Original Source:\nhttps://github.com/williamorim/pokemon\nCurated by Frank Hull:\nhttps://github.com/frankiethull"

    "text": "For this project, I’ve decided to take a look at former President Obama’s tweets while he was a president. Twitter is a social media platform. As you might have guessed from the name, its all about being social. Now, how social was Obama when he served as the US president? We’ll take a look at his mentioning habits.\n\n\nCode\ndetect_username &lt;- \"(?&lt;=@)\\\\w{1,15}\"\nobama_tweets &lt;- obama_tweets |&gt;\n  mutate(mentioned_user = str_extract_all(text, detect_username),\n         mentioned_user = \n           map(mentioned_user, ~if (length(.x) == 0){\n             NA_character_}\n             else .x),\n         has_mention = if_else(str_detect(text, detect_username),\n                               \"Yes\", \"No\"), \n         has_mention = factor(has_mention, levels = c\n                              (\"Yes\", \"No\")),\n         excl_count = str_count(text, \"!+\"),\n         ques_count = str_count(text, \"\\\\?+\"),\n         sentence_type = ifelse\n         (excl_count &gt; 0 & ques_count == 0, \"Exclamation\",\n           ifelse \n           (ques_count &gt; 0 & excl_count == 0, \"Question\",\n             ifelse \n             (excl_count &gt; 0 & ques_count &gt; 0, \"Both\", \"Neither\")\n             )\n           ),\n         sentence_type = factor(sentence_type, levels = c\n                                (\"Exclamation\",\n                                  \"Question\",\n                                  \"Both\",\n                                  \"Neither\"))\n         )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nuser_proportions &lt;- obama_tweets |&gt;\n  select(mentioned_user) |&gt;\n  unnest(mentioned_user) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(mentioned_user)) |&gt;\n  count(mentioned_user) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  filter(!n == 1) |&gt;\n  mutate(mentioned_user = fct_reorder(mentioned_user, proportion))\n\nmention_summary &lt;- obama_tweets |&gt;\n  count(has_mention) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))\n\nstyle_data &lt;- obama_tweets |&gt;\n  count(sentence_type) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmention_summary |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = has_mention, y = proportion, fill = has_mention)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Obama's tweets that include a mention\",\n    x = \"Did the tweet include a mention?\",\n    y = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table, we can see that President Obama didn’t really spend most of his time interacting with other users on Twitter. This includes all sorts of stuff like re tweeting other people’s tweets, or replying to tweets, since those things require the user to mention the original tweeter. It does make sense, since he was the President of the United States, so stuff like PR was probably very important to him, and he didn’t really have an incentive to engage other users. Still, try to be a bit less anti-social!\n\n\nCode\nuser_proportions |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = proportion, y = mentioned_user, fill = mentioned_user\n    )) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Obama's Most Mentioned Users\",\n    x = \"Proportion of Total Mentions\",\n    y = \"Username\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets take a look at who enjoyed President Obama’s mentions the most. I filtered out any username that Obama only mentioned once, since it cluttered up the visual and isn’t really important to see who Obama likes to interact with. But, man, isn’t this too little to be all the users Obama mentioned more than once? In fact, he tends to mention the user @POTUS much more than any other user, including his political ally @HillaryClinton, or @FLOTUS. It makes up nearly 10% of all his mentions! Makes Obama look a little bit like a clout chaser….\n\n\nCode\nstyle_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = sentence_type, y = proportion, fill = sentence_type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \n      \"Proportion of Obama's Tweets as Exclamations/Questions\",\n    x = \"Style of tweet\",\n    y = \"Proportion\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets take a look at what kind of style of tweets Obama likes to use. I classified tweets based on whether the tweet included an exclamation mark, a question mark, both, or neither. We can see that most of Obama’s tweets use neither of those punctuation marks, but he uses a lot more exclamation marks than question marks. He comes off a little bit like a mansplainer when we take a look at the data like this, especially since he rarely asks questions. Obama, its okay to admit when you don’t know something.\nCredit:\nData Sourced from:\nhttps://www.obamalibrary.gov/digital-research-room/archived-white-house-websites-and-social-media\nby the National Archives"
